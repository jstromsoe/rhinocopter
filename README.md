Code written for an Arduino board to pan/tilt some servos for an antenna tracker based on inputs from Mission Planner software.  These commands are sent over the serial link, interpreted by this code and sent as PWMs to the servos themselves.  It was edited because I am personally using a 5:1 gear ratio for my pan servo to increase its view to 360 degrees.  The tilt servo is currently 1:1, although that may change.
